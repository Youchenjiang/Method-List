# Android Automated Penetration Testing Framework

## Overview

The **Android Automated Penetration Testing Framework** is a comprehensive solution designed to automate the security assessment of Android applications. It bridges the gap between manual penetration testing and automated vulnerability scanning by integrating strategic analysis, infrastructure orchestration, and advanced execution engines.

This system is designed to serve both **Red Teams** (simulating real-world attacks) and **Blue Teams** (verifying defenses and compliance) by providing a unified workflow for vulnerability discovery, validation, and reporting.

## Core Value Proposition

Security testing is often bottlenecked by manual effort and high costs. This framework addresses these challenges through:

1.  **Cost Efficiency & ROI**: 
    - Early detection of vulnerabilities during the development lifecycle ("Shift Left") reduces remediation costs significantly compared to post-deployment fixes.
    - Automated regression testing ensures that fixed vulnerabilities do not reappear.

2.  **Compliance & Standards**:
    - The framework aligns with international standards such as **OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG)**.
    - It generates artifacts necessary for compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and Google Play policy requirements.

3.  **Scalability & Consistency**:
    - automated pipelines allow for consistent testing across multiple apps and versions without the fatigue or variability associated with human testers.
    - Integrated device farms enable parallel testing on various device configurations (OS versions, manufacturers).

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Strategy & Methodology
*   **[01_Testing_Methodology.md](01_Testing_Methodology.md)**: Defines the scope of testing, including static, dynamic, network, and forensic analysis. It outlines the core testing dimensions and value-add logic assessments.

### 2. System Architecture
*   **[02_System_Architecture.md](02_System_Architecture.md)**: Detailed technical design of the "Hybrid Engine 3.0" architecture. It explains the integration of "Agentic Android Analysis (A2)" concepts, covering the Reconnaissance, Execution, and Validation phases.

### 3. Infrastructure
*   **[03_Infrastructure_Setup.md](03_Infrastructure_Setup.md)**: Specifications for the physical and virtual infrastructure required to run the framework, including Pixel device farms, custom ROMs, and network proxies.

### 4. Operations & Workflow
*   **[04_Pipeline_Workflow.md](04_Pipeline_Workflow.md)**: Describes the end-to-end execution pipeline, from APK submission to report generation.
*   **[05_Core_Modules.md](05_Core_Modules.md)**: Deep dive into specific capabilities such as AI Navigation, Symbolication Services, and the Event Bus.
*   **[06_Agentic_MCP_Architecture.md](06_Agentic_MCP_Architecture.md)**: Guide to building a modular "HexStrike-like" Read Team platform using MobSF, APKTool, and ADB MCP servers.

## Getting Started

For new deployments, it is recommended to start with the **Infrastructure Setup** to ensure all hardware and software prerequisites are met before attempting to deploy the **System Architecture** components.
