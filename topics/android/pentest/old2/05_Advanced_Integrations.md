# Advanced Integrations & Capabilities

## Overview

Beyond standard penetration testing, the framework includes advanced modules designed to integrate with AI repair systems and deep technical analysis tools. These capabilities enable a **"Detect -> Diagnose -> Repair -> Verify"** closed-loop ecosystem.

## 1. RAG & Repair Module Integration
*Synergy with Blue Team Operations*

The Penetration Module serves as the "eyes" for the larger AI remediation system. It provides structured data to downstream Retreival-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Code Repair agents.

### Structured Vulnerability Feed (SVF)
Instead of raw logs, the system outputs standardized JSON objects (SARIF format) optimized for LLM consumption.

*   **Vulnerability Type**: CWE-ID (e.g., CWE-89 SQL Injection).
*   **Injection Point**: The precise UI element or API parameter.
*   **Runtime Context**: Snapshot of memory variables at the time of exploitation (e.g., `isAdmin=true`).
*   **Source Mapping**: The de-obfuscated file path and line number.

### Automated PoC Generation
To verify fixes, the system generates a **Replayable Proof-of-Concept**.
*   *Scenario*: If an XSS is found, the system generates a script that launches the intent with the malicious payload.
*   *Workflow*: The "Repair Module" applies a patch -> The "Verification Module" runs this PoC -> If the PoC fails (no alert/crash), the fix is verified.

## 2. Advanced AI Navigation
*Overcoming the "State Explosion" Problem*

Standard crawler tools (like Monkey) are random and inefficient. The framework utilizes a **Multimodal AI Navigator**.

*   **Visual Understanding**: A Vision-Language Model (VLM) analyzes the screenshot to understand UI semantics (e.g., "This is a login screen").
*   **Goal-Oriented Traversal**: The navigator is given a goal (e.g., "Find the Payment Settings"). It plans a path through the menus rather than clicking randomly.
*   **Smart Input Generation**: Instead of random strings, the AI generates context-aware inputs (e.g., valid-looking credit card numbers or addresses) to pass client-side validation logic.

## 3. Symbolication Service
*Bridging the Gap between Binaries and Source Code*

Modern Android apps are heavily obfuscated (ProGuard/R8). The Symbolication Service restores readability to crash logs and stack traces.

*   **Mapping Engine**: Maintains a database of `mapping.txt` files for each app version.
*   **Real-time Translation**: When the dynamic engine reports a hit at `a.b.c()`, the service automatically translates it to `com.secure.AuthParams.verify()` in the report, allowing developers to locate the flaw immediately.

## 4. Event-Driven Architecture
The system uses an **Event Bus** to decouple the Navigator from the Attack Modules.
*   **Topic**: `app.event.http_request`
*   **Subscriber**: SQL Injection Module.
*   **Action**: When a request is seen, the module wakes up, clones the request, modifies parameters, and sends it. This asynchronous approach ensures the main UI thread is never blocked by attack logic.
