# QA & Standards: The Human Certification

## 1. Overview: The Weakest Link

The "Cyborg" model fails if the "Human Kernel" is incompetent.
If the Pilot doesn't know how to fly, the Autopilot cannot save the plane.

This document defines the **Qualification Standards** for the operators of Engine 4.0 and the **Quality Assurance (QA)** metrics for the output.

## 2. Operator Qualifications

To operate the "Cyborg" system, the user must meet specific technical baselines. This is NOT a "Zero-Knowledge" tool.

| Skill Domain            | Minimum Requirement                                    | Reason                                                                         |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Android Internals**   | Understand `Activity`, `Intent`, `ContentProvider`.    | AI will say "Exported Activity found". Human must know why that matters.       |
| **Reverse Engineering** | Read crucial Smali snippets (Registers, method calls). | AI translations of Smali are often 80% correct. Human must spot the 20% error. |
| **Dynamic Analysis**    | Basic `Frida` syntax (`Java.use`, `Interceptor`).      | AI generates templates. Human must debug them when the App crashes.            |
| **Linux/Bash**          | Comfortable with `adb`, `grep`, pipes.                 | The system is a CLI-heavy workbench.                                           |

### 2.1 The "Fallback" Protocol
If the Operator encounters a situation beyond their skill (e.g., heavily obfuscated native library):
1.  **Stop**: Do not ask the AI to "guess".
2.  **Escalate**: Mark the task as `NEEDS_SENIOR_REVIEW`.
3.  **Delegate**: Transfer the specific `case_data.db` to a Senior Engineer.

## 3. System QA: Success Metrics

How do we know Engine 4.0 is working? We measure **Time-to-Value**, not just "Bug Count".

### 3.1 Efficiency Metrics
*   **Triage Speed**: Time from `APK Ingest` to `Attack Surface Mapped`.
    *   *Target*: < 5 minutes. (Previous Manual: 60 mins).
*   **Boilerplate Reduction**: % of code (Frida/Python) generated by AI vs. handwritten.
    *   *Target*: > 80% Generated.
*   **Context Reliance**: Number of times Human had to "Correct" the AI's hallucination.
    *   *Target*: < 1 per hour (achieved via RAG and Validation).

### 3.2 Reliability Metrics (The SLA)
*   **Infrastructure Uptime**: % of time the "Golden Device" is reachable via ADB.
    *   *Target*: 99% (Requires Watchdogs).
*   **False Positive Rate**: % of "Verified" bugs that are rejected by the Client.
    *   *Target*: 0%. (Because Human verify all reported bugs).

## 4. The "Definition of Done" (DoD)

A Penetration Test is not "Done" when the AI runs out of tokens. It is done when:

1.  **Coverage**: All "Exported" entry points have been either exploited or proven safe (Human Check).
2.  **Evidence**: Every reported finding has a **Reproducible Script** (PoC) attached in the database.
3.  **Review**: The Final Report has been read and signed by a Qualified Operator.

---

## 5. Training & Onboarding

To bridge the skill gap, we maintain a **Training Sandbox**.
*   **Target**: `GoatDroid` or `InsecureBankv2`.
*   **Curriculum**:
    1.  Use Engine 4.0 to scan the training app.
    2.  Use the AI to generate a root bypass.
    3.  Manually fix the generated script to make it work.
    *   *Pass Criteria*: Operator successfully exploits the app using the Cyborg workflow.

This ensures that only "Certified Pilots" operate the Exoskeleton.
